<p>This program is designed to generate different types of databases. Each generated database can be saved to a file with any extension.This is only the first version of the program and, therefore, there may be some problems in its work. In the future, the program will be improved.</p>
<h3>Types of databases</h3>
<p>1.Passwords</p>
<p>2.Numbers</p>
<p>3.IP-addresses</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Platform: OS Windows</p>
<p>Version:0.0.1</p>
<h3>Bugs and warnings</h3>
<p>If the program does not respond (most likely due to large values), do not close it as it continues to generate the base and after a while it will generate it.</p>
